        How do I use Git?

        Git is the most widely used modern version control system that is used in the world today!
        Git is a distributed version control system, meaning your local copy of code is a complete version control repository. These local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely. Work is commited locally, and then synced to the copy that is on the server, this differs from centralised version control as code does not need to be synced before being edited.

        Git's flexibility make it the perfect choice for any team in the tech industry, therefore it is important that many graduates know how to use this version control.

        Lets figure out how to use git, together!
      </section>
      <section>
        Setup
        The first thing that is needed to use Git is to install Git onto your operating system!

        Download Git for Windows

        Download Git for Linux

        Download Git for OSX
      </section>
      <section>
        Creating a Repository
        Once installed, you will want to create a brand new repository, to do this use the command in the commandline of the folder that will contain all of the files in your project

        git init

        This will create a new local repository on your system
      </section>
      <section>
        Checkout a Repository
        If you have already created a repository using GitHub or similar run this command

        git clone link/to/repository

        if you are using a remote repository, the command will be

        git clone username@host:link/to/repository
      </section>
      <section>
        The git workflow

        the local repository consists of trees that git maintains, these are

        The Working Directory

        This tree holds the actual files

        The Index

        This is the staging area for files

        The Head

        This points to the latest commit that has been made
      </section>
      <section>
        Adding and Committing files

        The next thing you will need have an understand of is how to add and commit files

        This means that you propose a change by adding it to the Index tree from the Working Directory tree, to do this use the command

        git add 'filename' to add a specific file

        git add . to add all changes

        This is the first step in a basic git workflow, the next step is to commit these changes to the Head tree. To do this use

        git commit -m "commit message"

        A good commit message is no longer than 72 characters long, but includes all changes that are being committed.
      </section>
      <section>
        Pushing your commits
        Once a commit has been completed, it is good practice to push these changes from the Head to the remote repository, to do this run the command

        git push origin master

        the branch is defined by the final word in this command, so ensure that if you are uploading to a different branch than master you choose the correct one in this command, for example if you are on the branch Feature1 the command would look

        git push origin Feature1

        If the repository is not connected to a remote repository yet, you will need to add this using

        git remote add origin "link to server"

        This will then allow changes to be pushed from the Head tree to the remote repository
      </section>
      <section>
        Branches
        When developing different features within a project, it is important to ensure that branches are used correctly.

        Branches are used to devlop different features that are isolated from each other, with the master branch being the default branch that is created when the repository is created. The main idea with branches is to use other branches to develop features and then merge all the branches together to the master branch for a complete project.

        To create a new branch, use the code

        git checkout -b feature_x

        To switch to another branch that is already created, such as master

        git checkout master

        To delete a branch

        git branch -d feature_x

        It is important to understand that a branch is not accessible by others unless the branch is pushed to the remote repository with

        git push origin 'branch'

      <section>
        Updating and Merging
        If you are working on a different computer, or someone else has updated the remote repository, you need to be able to retrieve the latest commits that are available

        To update your local repository to the latest commit, in your Working Directory use the command

        git pull

        this fetches all remote changes and merges them into your Directory.

        If the development on a branch is complete and it is time to merge the branch the master branch, use the code

        git merge "branch"

        This merges whichever branch you specified into your active branch, so ensure that your active branch is the master branch if you are doing a final merge!

        Git will usually try to auto merge changes when doing this, however sometimes it is not possible and there will be comflicts found. To fix this you will have to merge these specific files manually by editing the files that are shown in git.

        After you have fixed any conflicts, add these files as merged by using

        git add "filename"

        If you are unsure on the differences between two branches, you can preview each branch by using

        git diff "source-branch" "target-branch"

        This will allow you to understand what differences there are between two branches in your repository.
      </section>
      <section>
        Tagging
        You are able to create tags for software releases, this is known as a concept. You will add a tag to a specific commit that has been made, which would be used as a software relese. Add a tag by running

        git tag 1.0.0 74865s12sf

        this will add a tag called 1.0.0 to the commit with the id which starts with the first ten characters 74865s12sf.

        If you do not know where to find the commit id, you can find this in the log!

        Finding the git Log
        To simply view the repository log in a simple form, run the command

        git log

        There are many different ways to view a log

        To view commits from a specific person

        git log --author=name

        to see a compressed log where each commit is one line

        git log --pretty=oneline

        to see an ASCII art tree of all branches

        git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all

        to see what files have changed

        git log --name-status
      </section>
      <section>
        Undoing an error

        If you did something wrong (which will probably happen) it is easy to replace local changes using

        git checkout -- filename

        This code will replace the changes in your working directory with the latest content from this file in the Head, anything that is in the index will be kept.

        If you want to start over from the latest commit again, simply fetch everything from the remote repository again using

        git fetch origin

        Then point your local master branch at it again with

        git reset --hard origin/master
